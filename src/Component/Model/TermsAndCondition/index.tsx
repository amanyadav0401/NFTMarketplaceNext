            <li>
              Ownership and Declaration: By minting images on nft-world.one,
              you declare and confirm that you are the legal owner of the
              artwork being minted as NFT. You possess the necessary rights

              nft- world.one reserves the right to temporarily disable the
              artwork until a resolution is established between the
              contesting parties. nft-world.one shall not be held liable for
              any loss or inconvenience caused due to such actions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Platform Social Policies: All minted artworks must adhere to

              artwork without prior notice. This includes but is not limited
              to content that promotes hate speech, discrimination,

              promote discrimination against any gender, caste, creed,
              religion, or race. Any artwork found to be in violation of
              this principle may be subject to removal at the discretion of
              the administrators.

              process. It is your responsibility to ensure that all
