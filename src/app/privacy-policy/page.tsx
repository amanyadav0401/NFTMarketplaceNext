            Account Information. When you use our Service, you can add information to your account. We collect information and other data you add to your account, such as email address, username, linked social media accounts, favorited items and  collections, and other information you provide. Your Account Information (other than your email address) will be publicly visible. Remember public content can exist elsewhere on the internet even after you remove it from your account on nft-world.one.
            Feedback. If you provide us with feedback or contact us, we may receive your name and contact information (such as an email address), as well as any other content included in or associated with the message you send.
            Other Information. We also collect information and other data at other points in our Service where you voluntarily provide it or where we state that your information is being collected.
            Additionally, like much of web3, your blockchain wallet address functions as your identity on nft-world.one. Accordingly, you will need a blockchain wallet address and a third-party wallet to access certain aspects of the Service. We do not consider a blockchain wallet address, standing alone, to be information that identifies you. However, a blockchain wallet address may become associated with you or information you provide when you use our Service.

            As you navigate through and interact with our Service, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information, including:
            Interactions with our Service. To provide our Service, analyze trends, enforce our Terms of Service, and make the Service more useful to you, we collect information (typically Anonymous Data) from you when you interact with our Service, including, but not limited to, your browser type or fingerprint, operating system, IP address and associated geolocation, device ID, blockchain wallet address, wallet type, actions and clickstream data, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps. We may also store this data in log files.
            Cookies or Other Tracking Technologies. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to analyze how users interact with our Service, make improvements to our product quality, and provide users with a more personalized experience. In addition, we use "Pixel Tags" (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags allow us to analyze how users find our Service, make the Service more useful to you, and tailor your experience with us to meet your particular interests and needs.
            Do Not Track. As there is no common understanding about what a "Do Not Track" signal is supposed to mean, we don’t respond to those signals in any particular way. See further information below regarding how you may be able to withdraw your consent for the use of certain tracking technologies like cookies and pixel tags. You may also contact us here.
            We engage with third-party services ("Third Party Services"), including Google and Amplitude, to help collect some of the information referred to above. These Third Party Services, acting on our behalf, may collect information about your use of our Service through their own cookies, Pixel Tags, or other technologies ("Analytics Information"). The Third Party Services’ ability to use and share Analytics Information is restricted by such Third Party Services’ terms of use and privacy policy.
